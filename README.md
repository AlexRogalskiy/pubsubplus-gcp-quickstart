# Install a Solace Message Router onto a Google Compute Engine Linux Virtual Machine

The Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities deployable in any computing environment. The VMR provides the same rich feature set as Solaceâ€™s proven hardware appliances, with the same open protocol support, APIs and common management. The VMR can be deployed in the datacenter or natively within all popular private and public clouds. 

# How to Deploy a VRM
This is a 3 step process:

1. Go to the Solace Developer portal and request a Solace Comunity edition VRM. This process will return an email with a Download link.

</a>

2. Go to your Google Cloud Platform console and create a Compute Engine instance.  Ensure at least 2 vCPU and 4 GByte of memory and Centos7 OS:

3. Expand the the Management tab to expose the Automation Startup script panel

Cut and paste the code into the panel, replace -link to VMR Docker Image- with the link you recieved in step one.

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -f /var/lib/vmr-install.sh ]; then
  cd /var/lib
  yum install -y wget
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenBarr/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/vmr-install.sh
  chmod +x /var/lib/vmr-install.sh
  /var/lib/vmr-install.sh -i <link to VMR Docker Image>
fi
```
